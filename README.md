# CodeAlpha_TASK2_STOCK_PREDICTION
This project aims to predict the stock prices of TESLA using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the stock prices of NETFLIX for the period from May 2, 2018, to April 2, 2022. It includes various features such as the opening price, closing price, low price, etc.

# Note
Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook.
This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. The predictions made by the LSTM model may not always be accurate, and real-world stock market behavior can be highly unpredictable.
